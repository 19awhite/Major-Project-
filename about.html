        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>We are Abigail White and Mila Lanuel, two ambitious year 13 students from Wakatipu High School who are extremely passionate about making a difference in peoples lives by creating solutions to everyday problems.</p>
        <h2>What is Accessible Accessories?</h2>
        <p>Accessible Accessories is our 'brand' we have created, and through the process of 3D printing have designed a model of a cup holder for a wheel chair. We first discovered the issue when considering the prices of such accessories like cup or remote holders, they were extortionate. We considered the simplicity and material of these overpriced items and figured, why wouldn't our school's 3D printer be capable of printing a similar product with our own design. We set out on this venture with the intention of creating an available, accessible and inexpensive product for those that need it. We also considered the fact that most people in wheel chairs/with accessibility issues are likely to not earn a high income, therefore the need for these accessories may have previously been overlooked at such an extortionate price. </p>
